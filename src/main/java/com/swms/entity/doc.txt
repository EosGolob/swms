To create a systemized wholesale market for dresses, where the process involves three parties—Shop 1 (wholesaler), Agent (distributor), and Small Shops (retailers)—we can break the solution into a low-level and high-level design.

High-Level Design:
At a high level, this system can be designed with three core components:

Wholesaler Shop (Shop 1) – Where dresses are produced or bulk purchased.
Agent – An intermediary who sells the products to small shops.
Small Shops – Retailers that sell the dresses to the end consumer.
This system involves tracking the movement of products from the wholesaler through the agent and into the small shops, ensuring the inventory, order status, and payments are well-managed at each stage.

High-Level Components:

Inventory Management: Each shop (wholesaler, agent, small shops) must have an inventory system to track available products, stock levels, and sales.
Order Processing: A central system for managing orders placed by the agent for the small shops and those made by small shops directly.
Payment and Invoicing: A payment gateway for each shop to make payments to the previous step in the supply chain.
Reporting: Real-time reporting system to track orders, payments, and inventory.
User Management & Roles: Different roles for each type of user (admin, wholesaler, agent, and small shop owner), with permissions on order creation, view, and reporting.
High-Level Workflow:

Wholesaler (Shop 1):

List products for sale at wholesale prices.
Maintain inventory data (sizes, colors, quantity).
Process orders made by the agent.
Track payments from agents.
Agent:

Browse products available from the wholesaler.
Place bulk orders with the wholesaler on behalf of small shops.
Manage payments and deliveries from wholesalers to small shops.
Keep track of which small shop ordered what and when.
Small Shops (Retailers):

Place orders with agents.
Browse a catalog of available products.
Pay the agent for products.
Track inventory and sales.
Low-Level Design:
At a lower level, we can dive into the specifics of how the system is implemented.

Database Design:

Tables/Entities:
Products: product_id, name, category, size, color, wholesale_price, retail_price, stock_quantity
Shops: shop_id, shop_name, type (wholesaler, agent, retailer), contact_info, address
Orders: order_id, shop_id, product_id, quantity, price, order_status (pending, shipped, completed)
Payments: payment_id, order_id, amount, payment_status (paid, pending), payment_date
Inventory: product_id, shop_id, quantity_in_stock
Functionality (for each user):

Wholesaler:
Add new products to inventory.
List all products with prices and stock.
Process incoming orders from agents.
Manage payments from agents.
Agent:

Place orders for small shops.
Track order status and payment for each small shop.
Small Shops:

APIs / Communication:

Product Catalog API: Allows agents and small shops to view products available from wholesalers.
Order API: Allows agents to place orders for small shops, and small shops can place orders with agents.
Inventory API: Updates stock levels across shops as products are sold or ordered.
Payment API: Handles payment transactions and updates order statuses (paid/unpaid).
Reporting API: Allows different users to access reports on orders, payments, and inventory.
User Interface:

Wholesaler Dashboard:
Product listing and stock management.
Order management and payment tracking.

Agent Dashboard:
Order management interface for placing orders for small shops.
View product availability and prices.

Workflow Example:

Step 1: Wholesaler adds a product to the system with details (size, color, price, stock).
Step 2: Agent views the product catalog and places an order for a small shop with specific quantities.
Step 3: Agent completes the order, which is sent to the wholesaler for fulfillment.
Step 4: Payment is made from the agent to the wholesaler.
Step 5: Small Shop receives the product from the agent, updates its inventory, and proceeds with retail sales.
